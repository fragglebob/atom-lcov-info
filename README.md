## Atom lcov-info

### What

Displays code coverage information inside Atom based from information contained in an LCOV formatted file.

Using the current open file as a starting point, it traverses up the tree until the `coverage/lcov.info` file is found. As an example, while editing `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/client/test.coffee` coverage information could be pulled from either `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/coverage/lcov.info` or `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/coverage/lcov.info`. (First match as found.)
Or you can specify a path to this file in the settings (if the path is wrong, it will try to find it automatically).

It supports LCOV information as generated by tools such as Mocha, Karma, Istanbul, and others.

### Why

Some reasons why this package might fit the bill for you -

- Coverage information can be toggled for all views using `ctrl-alt-c`
- There is no additional configuration, your `coverage/lcov.info` file is automatically located
- Highlights are configurable to either show as a line (default) or in the gutter (less obtrusive)
- Both relative and absolute file paths outputs in the `lcov.info` file are supported
- It does matching irrespective of the platform, i.e. mix-and-match of / and \ style paths are supported
- A summary of the total coverage per line is displayed on the statusbar
- A overall project summary is available, along with at-point views of the different project files
- Covered lines are highlighted in green, uncovered lines in red by using `ctrl-alt-h`
- Coverage display can be configured for gutter-only, line & gutter
- Unobtrusive options to only display uncovered lines are available
- Has been tested with Karma, Mocha and Istanbul outputs

### How

Run your tests, generate a `coverage/lcov.info` file, toggle the coverage plugin and it displays.
